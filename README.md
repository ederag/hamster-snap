# Hamster time tracker snap

Hamster is time tracking for individuals. It helps you to keep track of how much time you have spent during the day on activities you choose to track.

Tips:

1. Make sure to **snap connect hamster-snap:system-observe** or do the equivalent in your respected software center(with snap plugin enabled) before launching the gui.
2.  If you have launched the older version or without the plug, make sure to kill the two background hamster-*-service before launching again, both services will be python processes.
